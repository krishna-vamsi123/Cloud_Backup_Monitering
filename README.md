# ☁️ Cloud-Based File Backup and Monitoring System

This project is a **Python-based cloud backup system** that allows users to securely back up local files to cloud storage platforms such as **AWS S3**. It provides **automated backup scheduling**, **data encryption**, and **file version tracking**, ensuring data safety and easy recovery.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔄 **Automated File Backup** to AWS S3
- 🔐 **SHA-256 Encryption Hashing** for integrity
- 📅 **Backup Scheduling** using Python's `schedule` library
- 🛡️ **Secure File Transfer**
- 📊 **Version Control** and easy file recovery
- 🖥️ Both **CLI and GUI versions** supported (expandable)
- ☁️ **Cloud Provider Integration** (AWS, GCP, Azure - modular)

## 💻 How It Works

User selects a file path to back up.

A SHA-256 hash is generated for file integrity.

The file is uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket with a unique name using timestamp and hash.

Backup runs automatically every day at midnight.

## 🔐 Sample Code Snippet

\`\`\`python
def backup_file(file_path, bucket_name):
    file_name = os.path.basename(file_path)
    file_hash = calculate_hash(file_path)
    backup_time = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S")
    s3_key = f"{file_hash}_{backup_time}_{file_name}"
    s3.upload_file(file_path, bucket_name, s3_key)
\`\`\`

## 🚀 How to Run

Clone the repo:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloud-backup-monitoring
cd cloud-backup-monitoring
\`\`\`

Install dependencies:

\`\`\`bash
pip install boto3 schedule
\`\`\`

Add your AWS credentials to the script:

\`\`\`python
s3 = boto3.client('s3', aws_access_key_id='YOUR_KEY', aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET')
\`\`\`

Run the script:

\`\`\`bash
python backup_script.py
\`\`\`

## 📈 Output Example

\`\`\`yaml
Starting backup process for file: report.txt
Generated hash: 3f786850...
Uploaded to S3: company-backups/3f786850..._timestamp_report.txt
Backup completed successfully!
